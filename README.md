# Offensive_Language_Detection_unibo
**Task**: The task consists of creating a deep learning model to detect hate speech or offensive language in texts. 

**Dataset**: The dataset attached is composed of tweets from Twitter, manually labelled as: 0 - hate speech 1 - offensive language 2 - neither.
Each entry of the dataset has several features

**Evaluation of results**: The metric used to evaluate the overall results is the macro-f1, I also provided the evaluation of the f1-accuracy for the single classes as well.

**Model**: I have chosen to perform fine-tuning on the DistilBERT model.

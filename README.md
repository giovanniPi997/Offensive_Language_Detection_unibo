# Offensive_Language_Detection_unibo
1. **Task**:
    - The task consists of creating a deep learning model to detect hate speech or offensive language in texts. 

2. **Dataset**:
    - The dataset attached is composed of tweets from Twitter, manually labelled as: 0 - hate speech 1 - offensive language 2 - neither. Each entry of the dataset has several features

3. **Evaluation of results**:
    - The metric used to evaluate the overall results is the macro-f1, I also provided the evaluation of the f1-accuracy for the single classes as well.

4. **Model**:
   - I have chosen to perform fine-tuning on the DistilBERT model.
